ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @adamDhalla 

I'm interested in seeing how machine learning, algorithms, and computer science can be applied to model natural and biological systems. I'm currently a high school sophomore,
and I've been interested in nature for nearly a decade. My interest in computer science is newer, and I started programming in early 2020, and with that, began to take an 
interest in abstract mathematics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 

I love learning, and I'm currently diving deeper into the mathematics behind neural network systems, as well as now learning how to practically apply them.

My website is [adamdhalla.com](https://adamdhalla.com), but I write around 6 articles a month on my Medium page [here:](https://medium.com/@adamdhalla). Most of these articles
recently are about mathematics in the concept of deep learning, but I often write articles on other subjects in computer science and nature. 

I also recently filmed and published a complete, five hour "course" on all the mathematics behind neural networks and specifically backpropagation, covering the matrix calculus
prerequisites required, and viewing backpropagation from two separate ways - and connecting them together. That's [here:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixl3nykKG9M).
