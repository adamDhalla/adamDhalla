ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @adamDhalla 

I'm interested in seeing how machine learning, algorithms, and computer science can be applied to model natural and biological systems. I'm currently a high school sophomore,
and I've been interested in nature for nearly a decade. My interest in computer science is newer, and I started programming in early 2020, and with that, began to take an 
interest in abstract mathematics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. 

My website is [adamdhalla.com](https://adamdhalla.com), but I write often (about algorithms, mathematics, and nature) [here:](https://medium.com/@adamdhalla). I also recently filmed and published a complete, five hour "course" on all the mathematics behind neural networks and specifically backpropagation. That's [here:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ixl3nykKG9M).

You can reach me at adamdhalla@protonmail.com.
